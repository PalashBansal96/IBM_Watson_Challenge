**Languages:**

We will be basically using python for the backend. We will us the facebook messenger SDK for python for the user interface. We will use the watson&#39;s RESTful API called via our python backend. Our backend will be in flask which is a BSD licensed microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2. Some of our code will also be in C to perform high performance modelling.

We will be hosting our main code of backend on the IBM bluemix, it will also be the main point of contact for the following IBM services that we will use.

- IBM Watson for the powerful natural language processing APIs
- IBM Cloudant DB to store all the queries and logs
- IBM Watson translation API to integrate more languages like Hindi for users who recently enrolled after Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna.
